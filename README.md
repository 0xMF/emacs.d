# A reasonable Emacs config for a seasoned vi/Vim user

This is my setup for the [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) editor. It tweaks [Steve
Purcell's emacs.d](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d) and makes his setup more natural for me, a
seasoned vi/[Vim](https://www.vim.org) user, to use.

In late 2017 I began by putting Emacs-specific settings into a sub-directory within my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/0xMF/dotfiles) repo but by May 2020 I found that strategy ineffective
and counter-intuitive particularly when making significant commit history changes. Once after I
cloned my `dotfiles` on several machines and realized I probably would never use the desktop
version of Emacs on those machines, I decided to fork Purcell's repo and put all my Emacs settings
in here so these settings and my `dotfiles` settings continue to be independent of each other at
all times.

Purcell's `emacs.d` repo proved dependable (logically consistent and remarkably stable) over
the years I used it. The eye-candy features Purcell keeps adding to his `emacs.d` setup has made
Emacs truly a delight that I enjoy using. Thanks Steve! If you are new to Purcell's setup, read his
[README](README_Purcell.md) (archived here since July 2020).

# Warning

Unlike Purcell whose `emacs.d` repo is dependable, this repo may be the exact opposite because I
use `git push -f` to my publicly available repos because I want a linear git commit history
without needless commits. I often do all my work on master alone (Gasp!). This means I may squash,
remove, or amend commits and their contents at any time.

As of July 2022, I use Emacs daily, which means I know a bit more Emacs and Elisp than when I
started. All my vi/Vim setup is in [init-0xMF-evil.el](lisp/init-0xMF-evil.el) but my knowledge of
both Emacs and Elisp is limited. I use the first change that works. Unfortunately, I cannot provide
*any* support for *any* Emacs or Elisp feature related to this setup.

Expert and experienced Emacs users may find my use [Evil](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil)
mode and [General](https://github.com/noctuid/general.el) in all their glory appalling, so this
repo would not be their ideal choice. In addition, experienced vi and Vim users may find my
keybinding choice horribly confusing (as I default to the Emacs keybindings whenever I see fit) so
they, too, would benefit from alternative approaches to using Emacs for vi/Vim users.
